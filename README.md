Face recognition is a step further to face detection. In face detection, we only detect the location of the human face in an image but in face recognition, we make a system that can identify humans.
Steps involved in a face recognition model:
Face Detection: Locate faces and draw bounding boxes around faces and keep the coordinates of bounding boxes.
Face Alignments: Normalize the faces to be consistent with the training database.once we have a image we send it to neural network which is pretrained and it gives us the encoded features
Feature Extraction: Extract features of faces that will be used for training and recognition tasks.we get 128 measurements/characteristics which are enough to distinguish and recognize the person
Face Recognition: Matching of the face against one or more known faces in a prepared database.
